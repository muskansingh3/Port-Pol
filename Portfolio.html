      <p>Hello! My name is Muskan Singh, and I am a dedicated and enthusiastic student currently studying in 12th grade at the age of just 12. From a very young age, I developed a strong interest in computers, design, and how websites work. This curiosity soon turned into a passion for front-end development. I love creating websites that are not only beautiful but also easy to use. My main skills include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m currently learning React JS to build more advanced, interactive web applications. I enjoy solving problems and making ideas come alive through code. Along with coding, I also love reading books, especially ones that teach me about science, different cultures, and inspiring people from around the world. Writing is another hobby I enjoy—it helps me express my thoughts creatively. I believe in hard work, creativity, and learning something new every day. My goal is to become a skilled web developer who builds useful and meaningful digital experiences. I may be young, but I am confident, focused, and excited about the journey ahead. I truly believe that age is just a number, and passion has no limits.</p>
